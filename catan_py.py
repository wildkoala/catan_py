We need to figure out how we're going to describe where people want to place their roads and where they want to place their settlements
I think we should specify which corners of a tile are open with "O" for open.
I think we need some colors in this game, even though its a terminal... can we do that? 
How else will we specify who has a corner? Is the first letter of the player name okay? What if there are two players with the same name?
Wouldn't that be confusing with the resources?

What will clients send?

How do i draw multiple tiles? I think I might just have 2 defined board sizes, and just populate the board randomly at the start of the game.


How do i
